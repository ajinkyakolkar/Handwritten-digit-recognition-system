# Handwritten-digit-recognition-system
Overview
This project is a handwritten digit recognition system built using machine learning techniques. The system can accurately recognize digits (0-9) from images.

Features
Preprocessing of handwritten digit images. Training of a neural network model for digit recognition. Evaluation of the model's performance. Real-time digit recognition from user input or image files.

Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used for the project.

TensorFlow/Keras: Used for building and training the neural network model.

OpenCV: Used for image processing tasks.

NumPy: Used for numerical operations and array manipulations.

Matplotlib: Employed for visualizing the results and plotting graphs.
